# Vehicle Detection and Classification System

## Project Overview

This project implements a **vehicle detection and classification** system using **traditional machine learning techniques** such as **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. The system is designed to detect and classify vehicles from images, and it is deployed via a **Flask API** for easy integration and use.

## Key Features

- **Vehicle Detection**: Using HOG and SVM to detect vehicles in images.
- **Vehicle Classification**: Classifies vehicles into categories such as cars, trucks, and bikes using machine learning models like Random Forest.
- **Flask API**: A simple Flask-based API to serve predictions and integrate with other applications.
- **Documentation**: A comprehensive guide on how to contribute to the project, including coding standards, testing, and branch management.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set it up on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** (recommend 3.6+)
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-detection-classification.git
```

### Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd vehicle-detection-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up the environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Then, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the Flask API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Flask API server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The server will start running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **API Endpoint**:
   The `/predict` endpoint accepts image files and returns vehicle detection and classification results.

   **Example request** using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F "file=@path/to/your/image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
   ```

   **Example response**:
   ```json
   {
       "vehicle_type": "car",
       "confidence": 0.92
   }
   ```

### Testing

To run the unit tests for the project:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

This will execute all the test cases and provide feedback on whether everything is working as expected.
