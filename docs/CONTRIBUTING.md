## Writing Unit Tests

Unit tests are crucial to ensure that your code works as expected and does not introduce new bugs.

1. **Create a test file** in the `tests/` directory.
2. **Write test cases** using Python's `unittest` or `pytest` framework.
3. **Run the tests** before submitting your changes to ensure everything works.

Example:
```python
import unittest
from feature_extraction import extract_hog_features

class TestFeatureExtraction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_extract_hog_features(self):
        image = "/path/to/sample_image.jpg"
        hog_features = extract_hog_features([image])
        self.assertGreater(len(hog_features), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
